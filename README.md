Project mirae is designed to help users preserve the environment. 
When users find trash, it provides information about the trash and allows them to directly mark the trash location. As data accumulates, we can see where the trash is in the world and help us clear it up. Users can read UN news and perform environmental challenges. 
Project mirae will continue to develop into services that help users work to save the planet.

## Project Structure


Project mirae is developed as a hybrid app using `flutter` to support Android and iOS. <br/>
Trash ai camera is designed using mobilenet-ssd with `tenserflow lite` for object detection. <br/>
`Firebase` was used to store the location data of the found trash. In addition, google map api was used to provide route of trash location.<br/>
`Google cloud platform` was used to member management to check users' own profiles and view rankings.<br/>

<br/><br/><br/>
